Apache ManifoldCF is a framework which facilitate connecting source content repositories to target repositories so that 
indexing and searching of content can be done. This falls under Enterprise Content Management(ECM) context. 
In present highly competitive enterprise culture ECM systems provide much needed efficiency, control and reduced costs.
There are different types of content in different repositories. Pretty straight forward examples would be 
Documentum, Microsoft Sharepoint and databases. But RSS feeds, Wikis and email exchanges are also taken as source 
repositories in enterprise level. If we take emails, still many enterprises use email as their primary official 
communication method. Emails contain many content with enterprise importance. 
ManifoldCF use repository connectors to connect these different types of content repositories. 
But yet ManifoldCF does not have a email connector. But as explained earlier emails carry a great importance in 
present enterprise. So it will be very elegant to have a email connector for ManifoldCF. 
Target of this project is to deliver an email connector for ManifoldCF.


Deliverables

1. Email connector for ManifoldCF
2. Test suit for Email connector(unit & integration)
2. User manual for email connector
